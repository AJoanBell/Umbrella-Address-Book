Project Name: Umbrella 

Project Application: Interactive Address Book

Project Members: Andrea Bell, Wendy Marcela Majia Ortiz, Alex Perry, Dan Smith, Sabrina Williams

## Project deployment: 
ðŸ’¡ See live version here: [https://marcelamejiao.github.io/Umbrella-Address-Book/](https://marcelamejiao.github.io/Umbrella-Address-Book/)

Github repository: https://github.com/marcelamejiao/Umbrella-Address-Book

## User Story:
AS A person wanting to socialise
I WANT an application to be able to look up my friends in an address book, see their address on a map, and what the weather is like where they are
SO THAT I can plan a visit to them (and know whether I need to take an umbrella or not)

## Project Requirements:

* Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, Materialize, Bulma, etc.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Acceptance Criteria

It's done when I am presented with a landing page where I can enter the address of my friend and save as a contact.

When I click on that contact, I am taken to a map displaying there location and the prevailing weather conditions of that location.

### Google Maps API:

The Google Maps API integration has two main components that are broken down into individual functions.
The 'renderMap' function and the 'addressToMap' function.
The main issue we experienced when working on the logic that would display the map of the contact's location and the details about the weather was that the renderMap function and the checkWeather function both took longitude and latitude values as variables to render the data. Because we do not expect users to enter their friend's longitude and latitude in their address book we needed a way to convert their address entries to the data type we needed (longitude and latitude). Luckily, we discovered within the Google Maps API there is a geocoding functionality. We used this to create the addressToMap function which parses through an address. Utilizing the Google Maps API, this address is searched for and the longitude and latitude values are a part of the data response. At the end of the function it then calls the checkWeather and renderMap functions using the longitude an latitude values as variables. This way the buttons can be programmed to call the addressToMap function, parsing through the relevant address and the app will render all the information needed.
