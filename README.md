## User Story:
AS A person wanting to socialise
I WANT an application to be able to look up my friends in an address book, see their address on a map, and what the weather is like where they are
SO THAT I can plan a visit to them (and know whether I need to take an umbrella or not)

## Project Requirements:

* Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, Materialize, Bulma, etc.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Acceptance Criteria

It's done when I am presented with a landing page where I can enter the address of my friend and save as a contact.

When I click on that contact, I am taken to a map displaying there location and the prevailing weather conditions of that location.
